# BinTraq ðŸ“¦ðŸ‘£

*A simple bin record keeping system for orchards.*

Try it out - sign up at https://bintraq.kwila.cloud, then contact bintraq@kwila.cloud to set up a usage agreement (you can't send SMS messages without it).

## How it Works

1. Add your bin pickers and their phone numbers fromo the **Pickers** page.
1. Set up your monthly SMS usage limits from the **SMS Usage** page.
1. As bins are picked, add them from the **Add Bin** page.
1. Trigger SMS message receipts for each bin from the **Pending** page.
   - Behind the scenes, BinTraq uses [SmokeTree](https://github.com/kwila-cloud/smoketree) to send and manage the SMS messages.
1. View the status of each sent bin from the **History** page.
