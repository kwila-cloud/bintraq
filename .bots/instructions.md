- Check that the `appVersion` in `app/src/lib/utils.ts` is incremented in every pull request.
  - BE SURE to raise a concern if the `appVersion` value isn't changed or `app/src/lib/utils.ts` isn't changed!
  - EXCEPTION: pull requests that have ZERO user-facing changes are NOT required to increment `appVersion`.
- Make sure that the pull request title follows the conventional commit style.
  - Alert the developer if the title is in the wrong format.
  - Example of a correct title: `fix: some bug`.
  - Example of an incorrect title: `Resolves "#18 - some bug"`.
  - The scope portion of conventional commit is not required.
